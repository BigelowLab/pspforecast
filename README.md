Shellfish toxicity forecast serving package

## Requirements

- [R v4+](https://www.r-project.org/)

- [rlang](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rlang)

- [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)

- [readr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=readr)

- [tidyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tidyr)

- [httr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=httr)

## Installation

    remotes::install_github("BigelowLab/pspforecast")

## Reading the forecast database

### Variables:

- version - the version/configuration of the model used to make the
  prediction

- ensemble_n - number of ensemble members used to generate prediction

- location - the sampling station the forecast is for

- date - the date the forecast was made on

- name - site name

- lat - latitude

- lon - longitude

- class_bins - the bins used to classify shellfish total toxicity
  (i.e.Â 0: 0-10, 1: 10-30, 2: 30-80, 3: \>80)

- forecast_date - the date the forecast is valid for (i.e.Â one week
  ahead of when it was made)

- predicted_class - the predicted classification at the location listed
  on the forecast_date (in this case 0-3)

- p_0 - class 0 probability

- p_1 - class 1 probability

- p_2 - class 2 probability

- p_3 - class 3 probability

- p3_sd - class 3 probability standard deviation

- p_3_min - class 3 minimum probability (from ensemble run)

- p_3_max - class 3 maximum probability (from ensemble run)

- predicted_class - the predicted classification
